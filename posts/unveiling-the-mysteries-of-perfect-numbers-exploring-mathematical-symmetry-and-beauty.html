          <p>Perfect numbers have fascinated mathematicians for centuries with their elegant properties and enigmatic nature. A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors, excluding itself. In other words, when all of a number’s divisors (except itself) are added together, the result is the number itself.</p>
<p>For example, the first perfect number is 6. Its proper divisors are 1, 2, and 3, and 1+2+3=61+2+3=6, making it a perfect number.</p>
<p>Another example is 28, where the sum of its proper divisors 1+2+4+7+14=281+2+4+7+14=28, thus making it a perfect number as well.</p>
<p>These perfect numbers are closely related to Mersenne primes, which are prime numbers that are one less than a power of two. Specifically, every even perfect number corresponds to a Mersenne prime through the formula mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>Perfect numbers are relatively rare, with only a few known examples. The first few perfect numbers are 6, 28, 496, and 8128. The discovery of perfect numbers has been driven by both mathematical curiosity and the search for patterns and relationships within the realm of number theory.</p>
<p>Perfect numbers continue to intrigue mathematicians, inspiring ongoing research into their properties and potential connections to other areas of mathematics. Despite their scarcity, these numbers remain an enduring symbol of mathematical beauty and intrigue.</p>
