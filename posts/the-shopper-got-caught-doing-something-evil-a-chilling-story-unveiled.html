          <p>In 2021, a disturbing video discovered on a phone by the police in Salt Lake City, Utah, unraveled a heartbreaking story that shook the community. The video initially appears playful but quickly turns sinister as the full context is revealed.</p>
<p>The story traces back to January 28, 1976, with the birth of Daniel Halseth in Estacada, Oregon. Raised on a family farm, Daniel developed a strong work ethic and deep appreciation for family. In high school, he excelled in various pursuits, earning the nickname “Drummer Dan” for his musical talents.</p>
<p>In 1994, Daniel faced a tragic loss when his father died suddenly. Despite this, he persevered, eventually earning degrees in music and business in Salem, Oregon, where he met Elizabeth Schwarak. The two married in 2001 and had three children before moving to Las Vegas for Daniel’s IT business.</p>
<p>Elizabeth pursued a political career, winning a state senate seat in 2010. However, her relationship with fellow politician Tiger Helgelian led to accusations of infidelity and a bitter divorce. Daniel was charged with “open and gross lewdness,” resulting in probation and losing custody of his children.</p>
<p>Elizabeth moved to Alaska with Tiger and the children, but Daniel continued to fight for his kids. In 2020, Elizabeth and the children returned to Las Vegas, and Daniel’s youngest daughter, Sierra, moved in with him. Despite court orders, Sierra remained with Daniel, leading to ongoing custody battles.</p>
<p>In April 2021, unusual withdrawals from Daniel’s bank account raised alarms. Daniel’s ex-wife Bogdana and his mother, Christine, failed to contact him. Christine’s increasing anxiety led to a welfare check, revealing that Daniel and Sierra were missing. The story’s chilling conclusion left a community grappling with the tragic and brutal reality behind the seemingly innocent video.</p>
